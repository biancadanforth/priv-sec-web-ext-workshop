Containers are a feature that we added to Firefox behind a preference to allow users to separate browsing.

> "lightweight persistent contexts that isolate sites from one another"

Containers give you the ability for a Work Gmail and Personal Gmail tab.

# Web extensions

[Web extensions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/What_are_WebExtensions) are a cross browser solution to what Chrome is shipping, it a clean and cross process safe set of APIs that many browsers are interested in using.

Firefox currently will run most of the same APIs that Chrome supports and are working on adding cleaner interfaces to these extensions also. Eg using promises for blocking [webRequest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/webRequest) features.

For cross browser feature support view individual MDN API pages EG: [tab.Tab compatibility table](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/tabs/Tab#Browser_compatibility)

# Legacy add-ons

Anyone familiar with Firefox add-ons will know that web extensions have not been around always. We are expiring the old style add-ons for various reasons in favour of Web Extensions.
